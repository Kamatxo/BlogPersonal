      "<p>To virtualize operating systems on a Mac with an M1 chip, we can only do it with Parallels, which is paid and very expensive, with VMWare, which requires registration, with VirtualBox for ARM which is still in Beta and doesn't work well, and with QEMU, which is very complicated to use.</p>",
      "<p>The UTM Virtual Machine is the graphical version of the QEMU virtual machine. QEMU is an open-source virtual machine that operates via commands, i.e., through the terminal. It‚Äôs a very complete machine for advanced users.</p>",
      "<p>With UTM, it‚Äôs much easier. It‚Äôs free, and you can download it from <a href=\"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/latest/download/UTM.dmg\"><b>here</b></a>. The main page of <a href=\"https://mac.getutm.app\"><b>UTM</b></a>. If you choose to download it, you will need to update it yourself.</p>",
      "<p>You can also download it through the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/es/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817?mt=12\"><b>AppStore</b></a>. It‚Äôs a one-time purchase, but you‚Äôll receive automatic updates for UTM and help the developers maintain UTM.</p>",
      "<p><b>What can we virtualize?</b></p>",
      "<p>With the UTM machine, we can virtualize many operating systems. ARM-based operating systems will work flawlessly, but Intel-based architectures may cause problems, so be careful. Once, during the installation of a very unusual Intel 32-bit OS, my MacBook overheated, and I had to abort the installation.</p>",
      "<p><b>Which operating systems have I managed to virtualize?</b></p>",
      "<p>The OSs have ranged from Windows 2.0.3, Windows XP, Windows 10 ARM, Windows 11 ARM, Ubuntu Server ARM, Kali ARM, Debian ARM, Windows Server 2008 R2,...</p>",
      "<p><b>Is it difficult to use?</b></p>",
      "<p>No, but if you come from VirtualBox, it might take a little longer to understand how it works. The installations are a bit more complicated, but once you learn, I think you won't want to use anything else.</p>",
